# About
This is a profile page which lists and provides filtering on Tretton37's ninjas.

# Feature Rationale

## Design/Accessibility
Overall structure of the page must be accessible to visually-impaired audiences. Therefore, using features such as semantic html, keyboard navigation, and screen reader functionality must take higher precedence over fancy animations. These requirements most meet the minimum: 

 - Keyboard only function (1 pt)
 - Screen reader function (1 pt)

## Functionality
The purpose of the page is to describe the Ninjas at Tretton37, so providing filtering/sorting features should take highest priority. Most likely an user will either (1) want to find people closest to them geographically, and (2) find examples of their work and who they are. Therefore, providing filters for geography and contact info would make the most sense. These requirements most meet the minimum: 

 - Filter by name and office (1 pt)
 - Filter by contact links (1 pt)

## Testing/QA
I typically take a test-driven approach, so having unit tests would make the most sense. These requirements most meet the minimum: 

 - Unit tests for existing functionality (reasonable coverage) (2 pt)
